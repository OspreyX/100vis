# 100 D3.js Visualizations

I started this pet-project as a way to improve my familiarity and speed with the
fantastic JavaScript visualization libarary: [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

I originally planned to do this for 365 days, but the thought was pretty
daunting, so I scaled it down to 100. Even if I fall behind some times, I should
be able to put out a visualization a day for three months. Some of the
visualizations will be small, but as long as I learn something new about D3, or
work with interesting data, it still counts.

Check out all the visualisations on the project's [GitHub
page](http://rowanu.github.io/100vis). You can contact and follow me [on
