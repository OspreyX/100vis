# 100 D3.js Visualizations

I started this pet-project as a way to improve my familiarity and speed with the
fantastic JavaScript visualization library: [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). Every
day for 100 days I will upload some kind of visualization using D3.

Check out the index of all visualisations on the project's [GitHub page](http://rowanu.github.io/100vis).
You can see descriptions for each visualization on [the blog](http://100vis.tumblr.com/).

You can contact and follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/elrowan), and see my technical blog at [dashboarddude.com](http://dashboarddude.com).

## Ideas

* Use events/dispatch http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848.

### 2013 Canada East Regionals Women Rank
* Resize points to show raw scores (ie. turn in to bubble chart).
* Use colour to show athlete. Put events/overall rank on axes.
